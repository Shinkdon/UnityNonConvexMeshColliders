- **Unity Version:** 2019.3 or newer
- **Memory:** At least 4GB RAM
- **Storage:** Minimum 100MB free space

## 🌐 Features
- Supports three types of non-convex MeshColliders
- Compatible with various types of rigid bodies
- Optimized for performance
- Easy integration into Unity projects

## 📥 Download & Install

8. **Import the Package:**  
   In Unity, go to the top menu and select `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package`. Navigate to the extracted folder. Find the `.unitypackage` file and select it, then click "Open." 

9. **Accept the Imports:**  
   A window will pop up showing the files included in the package. Click "Import" to add them to your Unity project.

## 🛠️ How to Use Non-Convex MeshColliders
1. **Add Non-Convex MeshCollider:**
   - Select the GameObject in your scene where you want to add the MeshCollider.
   - In the Inspector, click on "Add Component."
   - Type "MeshCollider" and select it from the list.

2. **Choose Mesh Properties:**
   - Find the MeshCollider component in the Inspector.
   - Check the "Convex" box if it’s unchecked. This enables the non-convex feature.

3. **Set Up Rigid Bodies:**
   - To make your GameObject interact with Unity physics, add a RigidBody component.
   - Select the GameObject again, click "Add Component," then search for "RigidBody" and add it.

4. **Test Your Setup:**
   - Use the Play button in Unity to test your setup in real-time. Adjust collider settings if needed for optimal performance.
